# Portfolio project

## Hi, and welcome!

This little project is designed to teach you linux, code management and give you something useful at the end of the day.

This is aimed more towards those learning the cloud, however most steps you are able to replicate locally, excluding `cloudrun` and `kubernetes`

As I am a Google Cloud engineer, I will write this with the expectation you will use GCP.

I'm writing this as an assignment, and later will provide writeup's on how to copmlete the steps - but what's important to note is that what I do and what you do are different. This is good. Everyone has different techniques and that's good.

## What you will learn

* Linux basics
  * Updating packages
  * Installing packages
  * Creating files
  * Removing files
  * Managing services
  * Remote access
* Cloud basics
  * Creating a cloud account

  * Using `Cloudrun`

## What results you will yeild
