# Assignment 2 - Wrapping it up in to a container


Now that you've got the site built, we're getting closer to putting it on the web. In order to share it with friends, we want to wrap it in a docker container

## What you will achieve here

By the end of this assignment, you will have built a docker container that runs locally, as well as pushing it to docker hub


# Let's start
Like mentioned, you've built your site locally, and it runs, but you want to show it off to your colleagues and your mom who is surprisingly technical! 

In order to share it in a simple way, we're going to package it in a docker container

## Grading

* Docker container runs
* Container is size optimised (Not crazyyyy big)
* All code is committed to git
* Pushed to docker hub and named well (`helloworld` will get you beaten)


## Technology to use

* Docker


## What your container needs to include

* HTML files
* Site loads by default when you hit the container (No custom domain, default port)
* docker ignore file



### Notes from the author

Use an nginx container, easy win!
